   @class AttachedDisk
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.autoDelete
   @summary Boolean - Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the instance).
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.boot
   @summary Boolean - Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.deviceName
   @summary String - Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.
   
   If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the form persistent-disks-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.diskEncryptionKey
   @summary [::CustomerEncryptionKey] - Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied encryption key.
   
   If you are creating a new disk, this field encrypts the new disk using an encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching an existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk using the customer-supplied encryption key.
   
   If you encrypt a disk using a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key again when you attempt to use this resource at a later time. For example, you must provide the key when you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or when you attach the disk to a virtual machine instance.
   
   If you do not provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk later.
   
   Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys to encrypt disks in a managed instance group.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.index
   @summary Integer - Assigns a zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved for the boot disk. For example, if you have many disks attached to an instance, each disk would have a unique index number. If not specified, the server will choose an appropriate value.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.initializeParams
   @summary [::AttachedDiskInitializeParams] - [Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk that will be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new instance.
   
   This property is mutually exclusive with the source property; you can only define one or the other, but not both.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.interface
   @summary String - Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk, which is either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. Persistent disks must always use SCSI and the request will fail if you attempt to attach a persistent disk in any other format than SCSI. Local SSDs can use either NVME or SCSI. For performance characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see Local SSD performance.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.kind
   @summary String - [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for attached disks.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.licenses
   @summary Array - [Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.mode
   @summary String - The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in READ_WRITE mode.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.source
   @summary String - Specifies a valid partial or full URL to an existing Persistent Disk resource. When creating a new instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required.
   
   If desired, you can also attach existing non-root persistent disks using this property. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
   
   Note that for InstanceTemplate, specify the disk name, not the URL for the disk.
   
   @variable AttachedDisk.type
   @summary String - Specifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or PERSISTENT. If not specified, the default is PERSISTENT.
   
   @class AttachedDiskInitializeParams
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable AttachedDiskInitializeParams.diskName
   @summary String - Specifies the disk name. If not specified, the default is to use the name of the instance.
   
   @variable AttachedDiskInitializeParams.diskSizeGb
   @summary String - Specifies the size of the disk in base-2 GB.
   
   @variable AttachedDiskInitializeParams.diskType
   @summary String - Specifies the disk type to use to create the instance. If not specified, the default is pd-standard, specified using the full URL. For example:
   
   https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/pd-standard 
   
   Other values include pd-ssd and local-ssd. If you define this field, you can provide either the full or partial URL. For example, the following are valid values:  
   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType 
   - projects/project/zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType 
   - zones/zone/diskTypes/diskType  Note that for InstanceTemplate, this is the name of the disk type, not URL.
   
   @variable AttachedDiskInitializeParams.sourceImage
   @summary String - The source image to create this disk. When creating a new instance, one of initializeParams.sourceImage or disks.source is required.
   
   To create a disk with one of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family name. For example, specify family/debian-8 to use the latest Debian 8 image:
   
   projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-8 
   
   Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system image:
   
   projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-8-jessie-vYYYYMMDD 
   
   To create a disk with a private image that you created, specify the image name in the following format:
   
   global/images/my-private-image 
   
   You can also specify a private image by its image family, which returns the latest version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with family/family-name:
   
   global/images/family/my-private-family 
   
   If the source image is deleted later, this field will not be set.
   
   @variable AttachedDiskInitializeParams.sourceImageEncryptionKey
   @summary [::CustomerEncryptionKey] - The customer-supplied encryption key of the source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
   
   Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption keys, so you cannot create disks for instances in a managed instance group if the source images are encrypted with your own keys.
   
   @class Autoscaler
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable Autoscaler.autoscalingPolicy
   @summary [::AutoscalingPolicy] - The configuration parameters for the autoscaling algorithm. You can define one or more of the policies for an autoscaler: cpuUtilization, customMetricUtilizations, and loadBalancingUtilization.

   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable AutoscalingPolicy.coolDownPeriodSec
   @summary Integer - The number of seconds that the autoscaler should wait before it starts collecting information from a new instance. This prevents the autoscaler from collecting information when the instance is initializing, during which the collected usage would not be reliable. The default time autoscaler waits is 60 seconds.
   
   Virtual machine initialization times might vary because of numerous factors. We recommend that you test how long an instance may take to initialize. To do this, create an instance and time the startup process.
   
   @variable AutoscalingPolicy.cpuUtilization

   @variable AutoscalingPolicyCpuUtilization.utilizationTarget
   @summary Number - The target CPU utilization that the autoscaler should maintain. Must be a float value in the range (0, 1]. If not specified, the default is 0.6.
   
   If the CPU level is below the target utilization, the autoscaler scales down the number of instances until it reaches the minimum number of instances you specified or until the average CPU of your instances reaches the target utilization.
   
   If the average CPU is above the target utilization, the autoscaler scales up until it reaches the maximum number of instances you specified or until the average utilization reaches the target utilization.
   
   @class AutoscalingPolicyCustomMetricUtilization
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable AutoscalingPolicyCustomMetricUtilization.metric
   @summary String - The identifier of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The metric cannot have negative values and should be a utilization metric, which means that the number of virtual machines handling requests should increase or decrease proportionally to the metric. The metric must also have a label of compute.googleapis.com/resource_id with the value of the instance's unique ID, although this alone does not guarantee that the metric is valid.
   
   For example, the following is a valid metric:
   compute.googleapis.com/instance/network/received_bytes_count
   The following is not a valid metric because it does not increase or decrease based on usage:

   @variable AutoscalingPolicyLoadBalancingUtilization.utilizationTarget
   @summary Number - Fraction of backend capacity utilization (set in HTTP(s) load balancing configuration) that autoscaler should maintain. Must be a positive float value. If not defined, the default is 0.8.
   
   @class Backend
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable Backend.balancingMode
   @summary String - Specifies the balancing mode for this backend. For global HTTP(S) or TCP/SSL load balancing, the default is UTILIZATION. Valid values are UTILIZATION, RATE (for HTTP(S)) and CONNECTION (for TCP/SSL).
   
   This cannot be used for internal load balancing.
   
   @variable Backend.capacityScaler
   @summary Number - A multiplier applied to the group's maximum servicing capacity (based on UTILIZATION, RATE or CONNECTION). Default value is 1, which means the group will serve up to 100% of its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].
   
   This cannot be used for internal load balancing.
   
   @variable Backend.description
   @summary String - An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.

  /**
     @function backendServices.aggregatedList
     @summary  Retrieves the list of all BackendService resources, regional and global, available to the specified project.
     @param {GoogleAPIClient} [api_client] API client as obtained by [../oauth/service::OAuthService::APISession] or [../service_account/service::run]
     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**
     @setting {String} [zone] The name of the zone for this request. **Required**

     @function machineTypes.aggregatedList
     @summary  Retrieves an aggregated list of machine types.

     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.

     @setting {optional String} [filter] Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the form filter={expression}. Your {expression} must be in the format: field_name comparison_string literal_string.
  
  The field_name is the name of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The literal value must match the entire field.
  
  For example, to filter for instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use filter=name ne example-instance.
  
  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results based on label values.
  
  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For example, (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match all expressions to pass the filters.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults, Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.
  
  You can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first.
  
  Currently, only sorting by name or creationTimestamp desc is supported.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Specifies a page token to use. Set pageToken to the nextPageToken returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results.
     @setting {String} [project] Project ID for this request. **Required**
     @return {::ZoneList}
