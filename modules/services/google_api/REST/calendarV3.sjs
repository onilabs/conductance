   @variable Event.iCalUID
   @summary String - Event unique identifier as defined in RFC5545. It is used to uniquely identify events accross calendaring systems and must be supplied when importing events via the import method.
   Note that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.
   
   @variable Event.id
   @summary String - Opaque identifier of the event. When creating new single or recurring events, you can specify their IDs. Provided IDs must follow these rules:  
   - characters allowed in the ID are those used in base32hex encoding, i.e. lowercase letters a-v and digits 0-9, see section 3.1.2 in RFC2938 
   - the length of the ID must be between 5 and 1024 characters 
   - the ID must be unique per calendar  Due to the globally distributed nature of the system, we cannot guarantee that ID collisions will be detected at event creation time. To minimize the risk of collisions we recommend using an established UUID algorithm such as one described in RFC4122.
   If you do not specify an ID, it will be automatically generated by the server.
   Note that the icalUID and the id are not identical and only one of them should be supplied at event creation time. One difference in their semantics is that in recurring events, all occurrences of one event have different ids while they all share the same icalUIDs.

  /**
     @function events.watch
     @summary  Watch for changes to Events resources.
     @param {GoogleAPIClient} [api_client] API client as obtained by [../oauth/service::OAuthService::APISession] or [../service_account/service::run]
     @param {Object} [settings] API call parameters
     @setting {::Channel} [resource] Data of [::Channel] structure
     @setting {optional Boolean} [alwaysIncludeEmail] Whether to always include a value in the email field for the organizer, creator and attendees, even if no real email is available (i.e. a generated, non-working value will be provided). The use of this option is discouraged and should only be used by clients which cannot handle the absence of an email address value in the mentioned places. Optional. The default is False.
     @setting {String} [calendarId] Calendar identifier. To retrieve calendar IDs call the calendarList.list method. If you want to access the primary calendar of the currently logged in user, use the "primary" keyword. **Required**
     @setting {optional String} [iCalUID] Specifies event ID in the iCalendar format to be included in the response. Optional.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxAttendees] The maximum number of attendees to include in the response. If there are more than the specified number of attendees, only the participant is returned. Optional.
     @setting {optional Integer} [maxResults] Maximum number of events returned on one result page. By default the value is 250 events. The page size can never be larger than 2500 events. Optional.
     @setting {optional String} [orderBy] The order of the events returned in the result. Optional. The default is an unspecified, stable order.
     @setting {optional String} [pageToken] Token specifying which result page to return. Optional.
     @setting {optional String} [privateExtendedProperty] Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only private properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
     @setting {optional String} [q] Free text search terms to find events that match these terms in any field, except for extended properties. Optional.
     @setting {optional String} [sharedExtendedProperty] Extended properties constraint specified as propertyName=value. Matches only shared properties. This parameter might be repeated multiple times to return events that match all given constraints.
     @setting {optional Boolean} [showDeleted] Whether to include deleted events (with status equals "cancelled") in the result. Cancelled instances of recurring events (but not the underlying recurring event) will still be included if showDeleted and singleEvents are both False. If showDeleted and singleEvents are both True, only single instances of deleted events (but not the underlying recurring events) are returned. Optional. The default is False.
     @setting {optional Boolean} [showHiddenInvitations] Whether to include hidden invitations in the result. Optional. The default is False.
     @setting {optional Boolean} [singleEvents] Whether to expand recurring events into instances and only return single one-off events and instances of recurring events, but not the underlying recurring events themselves. Optional. The default is False.
     @setting {optional String} [syncToken] Token obtained from the nextSyncToken field returned on the last page of results from the previous list request. It makes the result of this list request contain only entries that have changed since then. All events deleted since the previous list request will always be in the result set and it is not allowed to set showDeleted to False.
  There are several query parameters that cannot be specified together with nextSyncToken to ensure consistency of the client state.
  
  These are: 
  - iCalUID 
  - orderBy 
  - privateExtendedProperty 
  - q 
  - sharedExtendedProperty 
  - timeMin 
  - timeMax 
  - updatedMin If the syncToken expires, the server will respond with a 410 GONE response code and the client should clear its storage and perform a full synchronization without any syncToken.
  Learn more about incremental synchronization.
  Optional. The default is to return all entries.
     @setting {optional String} [timeMax] Upper bound (exclusive) for an event's start time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by start time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored.
     @setting {optional String} [timeMin] Lower bound (inclusive) for an event's end time to filter by. Optional. The default is not to filter by end time. Must be an RFC3339 timestamp with mandatory time zone offset, e.g., 2011-06-03T10:00:00-07:00, 2011-06-03T10:00:00Z. Milliseconds may be provided but will be ignored.
     @setting {optional String} [timeZone] Time zone used in the response. Optional. The default is the time zone of the calendar.
     @setting {optional String} [updatedMin] Lower bound for an event's last modification time (as a RFC3339 timestamp) to filter by. When specified, entries deleted since this time will always be included regardless of showDeleted. Optional. The default is not to filter by last modification time.
