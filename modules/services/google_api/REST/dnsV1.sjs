/**
   @class Change
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable Change.additions
   @summary Array - Which ResourceRecordSets to add?
   
   @variable Change.deletions
   @summary Array - Which ResourceRecordSets to remove? Must match existing data exactly.
   
   @variable Change.id
   @summary String - Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server (output only).
   
   @variable Change.kind
   @summary String - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#change".
   
   @variable Change.startTime
   @summary String - The time that this operation was started by the server (output only). This is in RFC3339 text format.
   
   @variable Change.status
   @summary String - Status of the operation (output only).
   
   @class ChangesListResponse
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable ChangesListResponse.changes
   @summary Array - The requested changes.
   
   @variable ChangesListResponse.kind
   @summary String - Type of resource.
   
   @variable ChangesListResponse.nextPageToken
   @summary String - The presence of this field indicates that there exist more results following your last page of results in pagination order. To fetch them, make another list request using this value as your pagination token.
   
   In this way you can retrieve the complete contents of even very large collections one page at a time. However, if the contents of the collection change between the first and last paginated list request, the set of all elements returned will be an inconsistent view of the collection. There is no way to retrieve a "snapshot" of collections larger than the maximum page size.
   
   @class ManagedZone
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable ManagedZone.creationTime
   @summary String - The time that this resource was created on the server. This is in RFC3339 text format. Output only.
   
   @variable ManagedZone.description
   @summary String - A mutable string of at most 1024 characters associated with this resource for the user's convenience. Has no effect on the managed zone's function.
   
   @variable ManagedZone.dnsName
   @summary String - The DNS name of this managed zone, for instance "example.com.".
   
   @variable ManagedZone.id
   @summary String - Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the server (output only)
   
   @variable ManagedZone.kind
   @summary String - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#managedZone".
   
   @variable ManagedZone.name
   @summary String - User assigned name for this resource. Must be unique within the project. The name must be 1-63 characters long, must begin with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and only contain lowercase letters, digits or dashes.
   
   @variable ManagedZone.nameServerSet
   @summary String - Optionally specifies the NameServerSet for this ManagedZone. A NameServerSet is a set of DNS name servers that all host the same ManagedZones. Most users will leave this field unset.
   
   @variable ManagedZone.nameServers
   @summary Array - Delegate your managed_zone to these virtual name servers; defined by the server (output only)
   
   @class ManagedZonesListResponse
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable ManagedZonesListResponse.kind
   @summary String - Type of resource.
   
   @variable ManagedZonesListResponse.managedZones
   @summary Array - The managed zone resources.
   
   @variable ManagedZonesListResponse.nextPageToken
   @summary String - The presence of this field indicates that there exist more results following your last page of results in pagination order. To fetch them, make another list request using this value as your page token.
   
   In this way you can retrieve the complete contents of even very large collections one page at a time. However, if the contents of the collection change between the first and last paginated list request, the set of all elements returned will be an inconsistent view of the collection. There is no way to retrieve a consistent snapshot of a collection larger than the maximum page size.
   
   @class Project
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable Project.id
   @summary String - User assigned unique identifier for the resource (output only).
   
   @variable Project.kind
   @summary String - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#project".
   
   @variable Project.number
   @summary String - Unique numeric identifier for the resource; defined by the server (output only).
   
   @variable Project.quota
   @summary [::Quota] - Quotas assigned to this project (output only).
   
   @class Quota
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable Quota.kind
   @summary String - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#quota".
   
   @variable Quota.managedZones
   @summary Integer - Maximum allowed number of managed zones in the project.
   
   @variable Quota.resourceRecordsPerRrset
   @summary Integer - Maximum allowed number of ResourceRecords per ResourceRecordSet.
   
   @variable Quota.rrsetAdditionsPerChange
   @summary Integer - Maximum allowed number of ResourceRecordSets to add per ChangesCreateRequest.
   
   @variable Quota.rrsetDeletionsPerChange
   @summary Integer - Maximum allowed number of ResourceRecordSets to delete per ChangesCreateRequest.
   
   @variable Quota.rrsetsPerManagedZone
   @summary Integer - Maximum allowed number of ResourceRecordSets per zone in the project.
   
   @variable Quota.totalRrdataSizePerChange
   @summary Integer - Maximum allowed size for total rrdata in one ChangesCreateRequest in bytes.
   
   @class ResourceRecordSet
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable ResourceRecordSet.kind
   @summary String - Identifies what kind of resource this is. Value: the fixed string "dns#resourceRecordSet".
   
   @variable ResourceRecordSet.name

   @variable ResourceRecordSet.rrdatas
   @summary Array - As defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1).
   
   @variable ResourceRecordSet.ttl
   @summary Integer - Number of seconds that this ResourceRecordSet can be cached by resolvers.
   
   @variable ResourceRecordSet.type
   @summary String - The identifier of a supported record type, for example, A, AAAA, MX, TXT, and so on.
   
   @class ResourceRecordSetsListResponse
   @summary Google API JSON structure
   
   @variable ResourceRecordSetsListResponse.kind
   @summary String - Type of resource.
   
   @variable ResourceRecordSetsListResponse.nextPageToken
   @summary String - The presence of this field indicates that there exist more results following your last page of results in pagination order. To fetch them, make another list request using this value as your pagination token.
